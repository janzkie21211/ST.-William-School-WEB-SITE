                        <p>First Communion is considered one of the holiest and most important occasions in a Roman Catholic's life. It means that person has received the Sacrament of the Eucharist, the body and blood of Jesus Christ. ... In order for anyone
                            to receive communion, that person must be without sin and in a state of grace.</p>

                        <p>A Catholic high school was established in San Marcelino in 1946 by the Rev. Thomas Pacano, SVD who also served as School Director. With him were Fr. Peter Guisto, Assistant Director and Mr. Ceferino Ladioray, School Principal,
                            then the Bureau of Private Schools Supervisor. Some Catholic lay people also helped, one of whom was the late Mr. Dalmacio Rodriguez who donated lumber for the school building. In 1949, the school was incorporated, given the
                            name Southern Zambales High School and government recognition for the complete secondary course.</p>

                        <p>Today, after so many eventful trials in its history, St. William’s School continues to stand with pride – with its Kindergarten, Elementary, and Secondary courses. It is ever committed to be a powerhouse for young boys and girls
                            in their growth for family, the Community and the Church. With the support of the parents, especially the active and generous Parents Homeroom Council, the Administration, the Faculty, and Staff assure the preparation of the
                            youth for the responsible roles they will take in building San Marcelino into an integral part of the Kingdom of God. Yes, with Rev. Ernesto Raymundo and Sister Marie Edissa Conel, SPC at the helm, SWS continues its dedication,
                            commitment, and service to the people of San Marcelino and its neighboring towns.</p>

                        <p>A school logo design should represent the institution in the best possible light. Logos are the most crucial part when starting an institution because it's the symbolism that conveys the school's branding. Lastly, it's also one
                            of the deciding factors for students to enroll or not</p>
